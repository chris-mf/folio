            National Disability Data Asset (NDDA) has been newly formed to bring together all available data relating to the disability community. 
        </p>


    <p class="paragraph">
        The brief was to help individuals and policy-makers choose which pathways worked, informed by data driven insights. Less wasted effort. Better outcomes for people living with disability.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
    Existing thinking was to create a single source of truth. To tell people which pathways lead to which outcomes. To rely on data to dictate the right answer for every situation.
</p>

            <h2>Creating the NDDA Insight Portal</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Creating better outcomes for people living with disabilities is complex. Some support pathways succeed, while others donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not always apparent why.  
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Over 14 weeks, we worked alongside NDDAâ€™s team â€” prototyping and testing with policy-makers, advocacy groups, and individuals.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Through testing, we discovered the underlying assumption was false. People donâ€™t want to be told which support pathway is best. The right answer is entirely dependent on their context.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            This powerful insight pivoted existing thinking â€” allowing us to focus on the true need. Helping people explore data themselves. Make their own connections. Bring their own expertise. Reach their own conclusions.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            This held true across all user-groups, from policy-makers to the public. Allowing us to define a single solution for all.

        <h2>Shifting the innovation mindset</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The largest impact of our work was instilling a design-led approach to NDDAâ€™s new product team, and NSWâ€™s Department of Premier and Cabinet.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        We provided a hands-on demonstration of designâ€™s ability to generate bulletproof strategy â€“ and turn that strategy into tangible, real world outcomes. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        This shifted the mindset from â€˜Innovation is a once off task. It only happens at the startâ€™  to design as an everyday practice â€“ constantly re-evaluating, improving, and innovating the product.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The NDDA team was able to successfully acquire more funding, and were seen as design leaders across the department as a whole.
