            Over the last 10 years I have worked on a wide spectrum of projects across finance, health and government. Recently I have been designing products and services with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Service NSW and City of Sydney Council.</p>

                                Whether you intentionally design for one or not someones well-being will be impacted by the work you produce. Everyone on the team, both the client side and practitioners are responsible for the well-being outcome of the project. 

                                This isn‚Äôt just how it looks or interacts, but what is the long behaviours we are informing by the products we release to the world.

                                        There will always be new things to learn and tools to use. You will never be an expert in all of them all of the time. Focus on always learning rather than trying to be a master. This will give you permission to fail which is one of the best ways to learn.

                                                The best the best thing that you can do for yourself and for the project is realise that you can't solve it on your own. You have to call in subject matter experts and people who know more about that topic. Only  then you can you aim to solve it collectively.

                                                        Being a mentor is not a job you apply for, or a task someone gives you. There is no minimum years in a particular role to do it. Mentoring someone is a role that you give yourself and doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. You can mentor someone from colour theory to public speaking, face to face or via email, the point is that you‚Äôre available and honest.
