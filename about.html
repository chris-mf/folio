            <div class="numbers">01</div>

                <h2>Everyone is responsible for the well-being outcome</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph wide-max ">
                Whether you intentionally design for one or not someones well-being will be impacted by the work you
                produce. Everyone on the team, both the client side and practitioners are responsible for the well-being
                outcome of the project.

                This isnâ€™t just how it looks or interacts, but what is the long behaviours we are informing by the
                products we release to the world.

                <h2>Have a learning mindset</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph wide-max ">
                There will always be new things to learn and tools to use. You will never be an expert in all of them
                all of the time. Focus on always learning rather than trying to be a master. This will give you
                permission to fail which is one of the best ways to learn.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph wide-max ">
                The best thing that you can do for yourself and for the project is realise that you can't solve it on
                your own. You have to call in subject matter experts and people who know more about that topic. Couple
                this with challenging assumptions throughout the process. Only then you can you aim to solve it
                collectively.

                <h2>Everyone can, and should mentor others</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph wide-max ">
                Being a mentor is not a job you apply for, or a task someone gives you. There is no minimum years in a
                particular role to do it. Mentoring someone is a role that you give yourself and doesnâ€™t have to be
                complicated. You can mentor someone from colour theory to public speaking, face to face or via email,
                the point is that youâ€™re available and honest.
            </p>

                <h2>Have an action bias</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph wide-max ">
                Making it real as quickly as possible is the only way to get a shared understanding of the problem and
                to build the confidence required to progress. You will get real
                reactions, not baseless opinions.
